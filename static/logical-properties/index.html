                This is first paragraph. paragraphs here are laid out
                accordingly to <code>writing-mode: verical-lr</code>
            </p>
            <p>This is seocnd paragraph</p>
            <p>This is third paragraph</p>
        </div>
        <p>
            Below are differently specified margins with or without respect to
            writing mode.
        </p>
        <div id="margin-block-start-example">
            <p>This has <code>margin-top</code></p>
            <p>This has <code>margin-block-start</code></p>
            <p>This does not have any margin</p>
        </div>

        <p>Below paragraph is wrapped, as it has max width of 100 px</p>
        <p class="bordered" style="max-width: 100px">THis is paragraph</p>

        <p>
            Below paragraph is not wrapped, although it has max width of 100 px,
            as it has vertical writing mode.
        </p>
        <p class="bordered" style="max-width: 100px; writing-mode: vertical-lr">
            THis is paragraph
        </p>

        <p>
            Below paragraph is wrapped, as it has
            <code>max-inline-size</code> of 100 px, so wrapping works with
            respect to writing mode.
        </p>
        <p
            class="bordered"
            style="max-inline-size: 100px; writing-mode: vertical-lr"
        >
            THis is paragraph
