        <h1>Introduction - making app installable</h1>
        <p>
            This page was made installable just by correctly wiring up the
            manifest file and filling it with relevant information. After that,
            this site was detected as "installable", thus becoming PWA.
        </p>
        <h2>App design</h2>
        <p>
            In order to apply different styles we can use media features, such
            as <code>display-mode</code>.
        </p>
        <div class="media-example">
            <p>
                This is example of the media feature, depending on it this
                paragraph has different background:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    if this page is displayed in browser, background should be
                    green,
                </li>
                <li>
                    if this is displayed as standalone (installed, though you
                    can pick how the app will display, about which later) and
                    with user preference of light mode, background is red
                </li>
                <li>
                    if this is displayed as standalone and with user preference
                    of dark mode, background is yellow
                </li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <p>
            Note that <code>standalone</code> mode matched also
            <code>@media (display-mode: browser)</code> query.
        </p>
        <p>
            Selection does not work very well in PWAs, so it is usually
            recommended to use
        </p>
        <pre><code class="block-code">.unselectable {
   user-select: none;
}</code></pre>
        <p>
            Sometimes, in PWAs (from Chrome on Android), PWAs have
            <b>pull to refresh</b> (when page is puled down, it refreshes) -
            this is not desirable in PWAs, so it can be disabled with
        </p>
        <pre><code class="block-code">body {
    overscroll-behavior-y: contain;
}</code></pre>
    </body>
</html>
