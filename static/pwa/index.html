        <h1>Introduction - making app installable</h1>
        <p>
            This page was made installable just by correctly wiring up the
            manifest file and filling it with relevant information. After that,
            this site was detected as "installable", thus becoming PWA.
        </p>
        <p>Below are further datails of building PWAs:</p>

            In order to apply different styles we can use media features, such
            as <code>display-mode</code>.
        </p>
        <div class="media-example">
            <p>
                This is example of the media feature, depending on it this
                paragraph has different background:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    if this page is displayed in browser, background should be
                    green,
                </li>
                <li>
                    if this is displayed as standalone (installed, though you
                    can pick how the app will display, about which later) and
                    with user preference of light mode, background is red
                </li>
                <li>
                    if this is displayed as standalone and with user preference
                    of dark mode, background is yellow
                </li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <p>
            Note that <code>standalone</code> mode matched also
            <code>@media (display-mode: browser)</code> query. On the other day,
            it did not, play with below snipper to verify (style should take
            precedence, when matched against above colorful paragraph):
        </p>
        <style
            style="
                display: block;
                font-family: 'Courier New', Courier, monospace;
            "
            contenteditable="true"
        >
            @media (display-mode: standalone) {
                .media-example {
                    background: red;
                }
            }
        </style>
        <p>
            Selection does not work very well in PWAs, so it is usually
            recommended to use
        </p>
        <pre><code class="block-code">.unselectable {
   user-select: none;
}</code></pre>
        <p>
            Sometimes, in PWAs (from Chrome on Android), PWAs have
            <b>pull to refresh</b> (when page is puled down, it refreshes) -
            this is not desirable in PWAs, so it can be disabled with
        </p>
        <pre><code class="block-code">body {
    overscroll-behavior-y: contain;
}</code></pre>

        <h2 id="service-workers">Service workers <a href="#">#</a></h2>
        <p>
            When registering service worker, it will act as a proxy between
            backend server and the PWA - service workter can decide where to
            reach for the resource.
        </p>
        <p>
            Not all browser support service workers, but if it dies, we need to
            register it as follows:
        </p>
        <pre><code class="block-code">if ('serviceWorker' in navigator) {
   navigator.serviceWorker.register("/serviceworker.js");
}</code></pre>
        <p>
            Below info indicates whether your browser supports service workers:
        </p>
        <p style="padding: 1ch" id="service-worker-support"></p>
        <script>
            const serviceWorkerSupported = 'serviceWorker' in navigator
            console.log('serviceWorkerSupported =', serviceWorkerSupported)

            if (serviceWorkerSupported) {
                console.log('Service worker supported.')
                navigator.serviceWorker.register('./serviceworker.js')
                console.log('Service worker registered.')
            }

            const swParagraph = document.getElementById(
                'service-worker-support'
            )

            const text =
                'Service workers' +
                (serviceWorkerSupported ? ' ' : ' not ') +
                'supported'
            const color = serviceWorkerSupported ? 'yellowgreen' : 'red'

            swParagraph.style.textAlign = 'center'
            swParagraph.style.backgroundColor = color
            swParagraph.innerText = text
            swParagraph.style.fontWeight = 'bolder'
        </script>

        <p>
            Service worker controls navigation for any route where the service
            worker is located or subroutes. So for example, service worker for
            this page will control requests to <code>/pwa</code> or
            <code>/pwa/othersite</code>, but not root path <code>/</code> or
            <code>/html-notes</code> route.
        </p>
        <h3>Updating service worker</h3>
        <p>
            In order to update service worker, we must not rename it, and on
            client side - we need to navigate away from all occurences of the
            page (PWAs, browser tabs). Then re-navigate to desired page.
        </p>
        <h3>Lifespan</h3>
        <p>
            Service workers are terminated when they've been idle for a few
            seconds or if they've been busy for too long.
        </p>

        <h2 id="cache-storage-api">Cache storage API <a href="#">#</a></h2>
        <p>
            We can use this API to cache various types of resources, such as CSS
            files, fonts, etc. The cache also includes headers for the HTTP
            requests (for CSSes and other).
        </p>
        <p>Caching can be chieved with following code:</p>
        <pre><code class='block-code'>caches.open('pwa-practice-assets').then((cache) => {
    cache.add('pwa.css')
})</code></pre>

        <p>
            See example in this page (JS file contains cache setting) and this
            can be inspected by going to <code>Application</code> tab in
            DevTools, there will be <code>Cache storage</code> on the left pane.
        </p>
        <p>
            See the
            <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Cache"
                >Cache object documentation</a
            >
            for further details.
        </p>

        <h2 id="serving">
            Serving repsonse from service worker <a href="#">#</a>
        </h2>
        <p>
            Thanks to service worker's <code>fetch</code> event, we have ability
            to proxy all reuqests in service worker's scope (so current route or
            subroutes). For example:
        </p>
        <pre><code class='block-code'>self.addEventListener("fetch", event => {
    console.log(`URL requested: ${event.request.url}`);
});</code></pre>
        <p>
            Log can be inspected in the dev tools (above is the real
            implementation). Moreover, below we have <code>link</code> to styles
            <code>not-existing.css</code>, which do not exist - we use service
            worker "proxying" to serve the CSS file.
        </p>
        <link rel="stylesheet" href="not-existing.css" type="text/css" />

        <div
            class="bordered"
            style="padding: 1ch"
            id="from-not-existing-styles"
        >
            <h1 id="from-not-existing-styles-header"></h1>
            <p>
                If service worker proxied request for non-existing CSS file,
                this paragraph should have bold and purple font, with pink
                background.
            </p>
        </div>
        <h3>Notes about code</h3>
        <p>
            Inside <code>fetch</code> event handler in service worker,
            <code>FetchEvent.respondWith</code> MUST be called synchronously. So
            no <code>await</code>s can be used before it, neither can it be used
            inside <code>then</code> method of a <code>Promise</code>. Luckily,
            <code>FetchEvent.respondWith</code> accepts
            <code>Response</code> object or <code>Promise</code> object, that
            resolves to <code>Response</code> object. So we can produce response
            asynchronously inside <code>FetchEvent.respondWith</code> method.
        </p>
        <p>
            This page uses service worker and Cache API - all can be inspected
            in dev tools - in console and in appropriate places in
            <code>Application</code> tab.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Caution:</b> The Response's body is a
            <code>ReadableStream</code> that can only be consumed once. That
            means that if you call <code>fetch()</code> to deliver the response
            to the PWA because the asset was not cached, you cannot reuse the
            same response for updating it in the cache. You need to call
            <code>Response.clone()</code> to use it twice.
        </p>

        <p>
            Browser can be asked to prsist the data stored in browsser's
            whatever storage (inlcuding service workers), to not be removed upon
            long inactivity (no usage of the data) or on storage pressure. Users
            can still forcibly remove the data, but browser will persist data
            (when asked and granted).
        </p>
        <p>
            To request peristent storage, we need to call
            <code>StorageManager.persist()</code> method, which can be accessed
            with <code>navigator.storage</code> object. For example:
        </p>
        <pre><code class='block-code'>async function persistData() {
  if (navigator.storage && navigator.storage.persist) {
    const result = await navigator.storage.persist();
    console.log(`Data persisted: ${result}`);
  }
}</code></pre>
        <p>
            You can also check if persistent storage is already granted in the
            current origin by calling <code>StorageManager.persisted()</code>.

        <h3>iOS and iPadOS installation</h3>

        <p>
            to instruct the browser/system to use that icon as application icon.
            If not specified, icon will be screenshot of the PWA at the moment
            of installation.

        <h2 id="web-app-manifest">Web App Manifest <a href="#">#</a></h2>
        <p>
            Manifest file defines how the app should behave, when installed as
            native app. This file should have
            <code>.webmanifest</code> extension, but in general
            <code>manifest.json</code> is used broadly, as long as it is linked
            from HTML correctly. One can manifest file for this page and how it
            is linked in root page (<code>rel="manifest"</code> attribute on
            <code>link</code> element suffices for correct linking the manifest

            are used to create splash screen (shown when launching app). Here is
            a breakdown:
        </p>
        <img src="../android_splash_screen_and_manifest.png" width="100%" />

        <p>
            Safari on iOS and iPadOS does not use the web app manifest to
            generate splash screens. Instead, they use an image linked from a
            proprietary
            <code>&lt;link&gt;</code> element similar to how they handle icons:
        </p>
        <code class="block-code"
            >&lt;link rel="apple-touch-startup-image"
            href="ios-startup.png"&gt;</code
        >
        <p>
            The challenge is that the startup image must have the exact window
            size that your PWA will have on opening. So, different iOS and
            iPadOS devices will need different images.
        </p>
        <p>
            Different versions of the launch image can be set with a media query
            inside the media attribute:
        </p>
        <pre><code class="block-code">&lt;link rel="apple-touch-startup-image" href="ios-startup.png"
      media="orientation: portrait"&gt;
&lt;link rel="apple-touch-startup-image" href="ios-startup-landscape.png"
      media="orientation: landscape"&gt;</code></pre>

        <h3>Extended, optional fields</h3>
        <p>Below fields are optional in manifest file:</p>
        <dl>
            <dt><code>lang</code></dt>
            <dd>Primary language of the manifest's values.</dd>
            <dt><code>dir</code></dt>
            <dd>The direction to display direction-capable manifest fields.</dd>
            <dt><code>oreitnation</code></dt>
            <dd>
                Desired orientation for the app once installed. For instance, a
                game may set this to request a landscape-only orientation.
            </dd>
        </dl>

        <h3>Promotional fields</h3>
        <p>
            Such manifest file's fields are used to provide promotional
            information about PWA, for instance, in install flows, listings and
            search results:
        </p>
        <dl>
            <dt><code>description</code></dt>
            <dd>An explanation of what PWA does.</dd>
            <dt><code>screenshots</code></dt>
            <dd>
                Array of screenshot objects with <code>src</code>,
                <code>type</code> and <code>sizes</code> (similar to the
                <code>icons</code> object) intented to showcase the PWA. There
                are no size restrictions.
            </dd>
            <dt><code>categories</code></dt>
            <dd>
                Array of categories the PWA should belong to beused as hints for
                listings. These values are typically lowercase.
            </dd>
            <dt><code>iarc_rating_id</code></dt>
            <dd>
                The International Age Rating Coalition certification code for
                the PWA, if you have one. It is intented to be used to determine
                which ages your PWA is appropriate for.
            </dd>
        </dl>
        <p>
            Installation experience can be greatly enhanced when using
            promotional fields. On Android, for example, if your PWA is
            installable and you provide values for at least
            <code>description</code> and <code>screenshots</code> fields, the
            installation dialog experience transforms from a simple "Add to the
            home screen" info bar, to a richer installation dialog similar to
            the one from an app store.
        </p>

        <h4><code>shortcuts</code> in manifest file</h4>
        <p>
            We can enhance PWA by adding shortcuts in manifest file, which add
            folliwng shortcuts to "quick menu" in task bar (on Windows and
            Android)
        </p>

        <img src="../images/pwa_shortcuts.png" />

        <h2 id="installation-prompt">Installation Prompt <a href="#">#</a></h2>
        <p>
            Depending on OS and browser, and on manifest file (promotional
            files), browser can show simple bar to install the app, enhanced UI
            using promotional fields to create installation dialog (as for
            native apps).
        </p>
        <p>
            More advanced technique is to listen to
            <code>beforeinstallprompt</code>, which is fired by the browser,
            when it detects that the page is installable (so passes
            installability criteria for PWAs).
        </p>
        <p>Here's small implementation:</p>
        <pre><code class="block-code">// This variable will save the event for later use.
let deferredPrompt;
window.addEventListener('beforeinstallprompt', (e) => {
  // Prevents the default mini-infobar or install dialog
  // from appearing on mobile
  e.preventDefault();
  // Save the event because you'll need to trigger it later.
  deferredPrompt = e;
  // Show your customized install prompt for your PWA
  // Your own UI doesn't have to be a single element, you
  // can have buttons in different locations, or wait to prompt
  // as part of a critical journey.
  showInAppInstallPromotion();
});</code></pre>
        <p class="caution">CAUTION: Not all browsers support this event.</p>

        <p>
            To prompot user for installation, use
            <code>deferredPrompt.prompt()</code> method. But this method can be
            called only once. If user dismisses it, it needs to wait until next
            time, when <code>beforeinstallprompt</code> event is fired.
        </p>
        <p>The event won't fire when:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>the user has already installed the current PWA,</li>
            <li>the app does not pass PWA installation criteria,</li>
            <li>
                the PWA is not installable on the current device for other
                reasons (for example, a device in kiosk mode or without
                permissions).
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>To see user's choice, we can use below code:</p>
        <pre><code class="block-code">const { outcome } = await deferredPrompt.userChoice;</code></pre>
        <p class="remark">
            Chromium browsers trigger the <code>appinstalled</code> event on the
            <code>window</code> object. The event is fired when the user accepts
            the install, whether action was triggered by a custom install button
            or by the browser.

        <p>
            To avoid reading user agent string, we can check
            <code>navigator.standalone</code> property, which is available only
            on the WebKit engine on iOS and iPadOS.
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>
                <code>navigator.standalone</code> is <code>undefined</code> -
                user is neither on iOS or iPadOs
            </li>
            <li>
                <code>navigator.standalone</code> is <code>false</code> - user
                opened PWA in browser
            </li>
            <li>
                <code>navigator.standalone</code> is <code>trye</code> - user is
                using PWA as standalone app.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            Apple does not suport <code>display: fullscreen</code>, as Android
            does. In order to provide this experience we need to use
            <code>meta</code> tag:
        </p>
        <code class="block-code"
            >&lt;meta name="apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style"
            content="black-translucent"&gt;</code
        >
    </body>
