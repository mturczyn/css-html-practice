        <h1>Introduction - making app installable</h1>
        <p>
            This page was made installable just by correctly wiring up the
            manifest file and filling it with relevant information. After that,
            this site was detected as "installable", thus becoming PWA.
        </p>
        <p>Below are further datails of building PWAs:</p>
        <ul id="toc">
            <li><a href="#app-design">App design</a></li>
            <li><a href="#service-workers">Service workers</a></li>
            <li><a href="#cache-storage-api">Cache Storage API</a></li>
            <li><a href="#serving">Serving repsonse from service worker</a></li>
        </ul>

        <h2 id="app-design">App design<a href="#">#</a></h2>
        <p>
            In order to apply different styles we can use media features, such
            as <code>display-mode</code>.
        </p>
        <div class="media-example">
            <p>
                This is example of the media feature, depending on it this
                paragraph has different background:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    if this page is displayed in browser, background should be
                    green,
                </li>
                <li>
                    if this is displayed as standalone (installed, though you
                    can pick how the app will display, about which later) and
                    with user preference of light mode, background is red
                </li>
                <li>
                    if this is displayed as standalone and with user preference
                    of dark mode, background is yellow
                </li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <p>
            Note that <code>standalone</code> mode matched also
            <code>@media (display-mode: browser)</code> query. On the other day,
            it did not, play with below snipper to verify (style should take
            precedence, when matched against above colorful paragraph):
        </p>
        <style
            style="
                display: block;
                font-family: 'Courier New', Courier, monospace;
            "
            contenteditable="true"
        >
            @media (display-mode: standalone) {
                .media-example {
                    background: red;
                }
            }
        </style>
        <p>
            Selection does not work very well in PWAs, so it is usually
            recommended to use
        </p>
        <pre><code class="block-code">.unselectable {
   user-select: none;
}</code></pre>
        <p>
            Sometimes, in PWAs (from Chrome on Android), PWAs have
            <b>pull to refresh</b> (when page is puled down, it refreshes) -
            this is not desirable in PWAs, so it can be disabled with
        </p>
        <pre><code class="block-code">body {
    overscroll-behavior-y: contain;
}</code></pre>

        <h2 id="service-workers">Service workers<a href="#">#</a></h2>
        <p>
            When registering service worker, it will act as a proxy between
            backend server and the PWA - service workter can decide where to
            reach for the resource.
        </p>
        <p>
            Not all browser support service workers, but if it dies, we need to
            register it as follows:
        </p>
        <pre><code class="block-code">if ('serviceWorker' in navigator) {
   navigator.serviceWorker.register("/serviceworker.js");
}</code></pre>
        <p>
            Below info indicates whether your browser supports service workers:
        </p>
        <p style="padding: 1ch" id="service-worker-support"></p>
        <script>
            const serviceWorkerSupported = 'serviceWorker' in navigator
            console.log('serviceWorkerSupported =', serviceWorkerSupported)

            if (serviceWorkerSupported) {
                console.log('Service worker supported.')
                navigator.serviceWorker.register('./serviceworker.js')
                console.log('Service worker registered.')
            }

            const swParagraph = document.getElementById(
                'service-worker-support'
            )

            const text =
                'Service workers' +
                (serviceWorkerSupported ? ' ' : ' not ') +
                'supported'
            const color = serviceWorkerSupported ? 'yellowgreen' : 'red'

            swParagraph.style.textAlign = 'center'
            swParagraph.style.backgroundColor = color
            swParagraph.innerText = text
            swParagraph.style.fontWeight = 'bolder'
        </script>

        <p>
            Service worker controls navigation for any route where the service
            worker is located or subroutes. So for example, service worker for
            this page will control requests to <code>/pwa</code> or
            <code>/pwa/othersite</code>, but not root path <code>/</code> or
            <code>/html-notes</code> route.
        </p>
        <h3>Updating service worker</h3>
        <p>
            In order to update service worker, we must not rename it, and on
            client side - we need to navigate away from all occurences of the
            page (PWAs, browser tabs). Then re-navigate to desired page.
        </p>
        <h3>Lifespan</h3>
        <p>
            Service workers are terminated when they've been idle for a few
            seconds or if they've been busy for too long.
        </p>

        <h2 id="cache-storage-api">Cache storage API<a href="#">#</a></h2>
        <p>
            We can use this API to cache various types of resources, such as CSS
            files, fonts, etc. The cache also includes headers for the HTTP
            requests (for CSSes and other).
        </p>
        <p>Caching can be chieved with following code:</p>
        <pre><code class='block-code'>caches.open('pwa-practice-assets').then((cache) => {
    cache.add('pwa.css')
})</code></pre>

        <p>
            See example in this page (JS file contains cache setting) and this
            can be inspected by going to <code>Application</code> tab in
            DevTools, there will be <code>Cache storage</code> on the left pane.
        </p>
        <p>
            See the
            <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Cache"
                >Cache object documentation</a
            >
            for further details.
        </p>

        <h2 id="serving">
            Serving repsonse from service worker<a href="#">#</a>
        </h2>
        <p>
            Thanks to service worker's <code>fetch</code> event, we have ability
            to proxy all reuqests in service worker's scope (so current route or
            subroutes). For example:
        </p>
        <pre><code class='block-code'>self.addEventListener("fetch", event => {
    console.log(`URL requested: ${event.request.url}`);
});</code></pre>
        <p>
            Log can be inspected in the dev tools (above is the real
            implementation). Moreover, below we have <code>link</code> to styles
            <code>not-existing.css</code>, which do not exist - we use service
            worker "proxying" to serve the CSS file.
        </p>
        <link rel="stylesheet" href="not-existing.css" type="text/css" />
        <p class="bordered" style="padding: 1ch" id="from-not-existing-styles">
            If service worker proxied request for non-existing CSS file, this
            paragraph should have bold and purple font, with pink background.
        </p>
