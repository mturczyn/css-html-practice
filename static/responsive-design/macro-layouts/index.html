                <p>
                    This page uses media query to display
                    <code>main</code> element as grid (<code
                        >grid-template-columns: 2fr 1fr</code
                    >), when the viewport width is wider than <code>45em</code>.
                </p>
                <h1>My web page</h1>
                <p>
                    This is my web page. There are many like it but this one is
                    mine.

                <p>
                    I`m using the HyperText Markup Language (<dfn>HTML</dfn>) to
                    give structure to this page.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For example, this text is inside a paragraph which is inside
                    an article which is inside the main content.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For the tangential information that follows, I`m using the
                    <code>aside</code> element.

                    The page was created by Tim Berners-Lee in the early 90s and
                    it still works in a modern web browser.

        <h1>Using correct CSS instead of media queries</h1>

        <p>
            If we would have to create UI that displays cards, that cannot be
            wider than 15em, we could try to write media queries with many
            breakpoints, at 15em, 30em and so on, to account for all display
            outputs, but instead we also can define correctly grid properties
            alone:
            <code
                >grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fill, minmax(15em,
                1fr))</code
            >.
        </p>

                <h2>A card</h2>

                    A card might have all sorts of content inside it. This one
                    happens to have two paragraphs of text.

                    Actually, that’s not true. This particular card has three

        <h2>Summary</h2>
        <p>
            By applying some smart rules in flexbox or grid, it's possible to
            design dynamic macro layouts with minimal CSS and without any media
            queries. That's less work for you—you're making the browser do the
            calculations instead. To see some examples of modern CSS layouts
            that are fluid without requiring media queries, see
            <a href="https://1linelayouts.glitch.me">1linelayouts.com</a>.
        </p>
        <h3>Example: super centered</h3>
        <p>
            Content below will be centered in its parent, which has
            <code>style="display: grid; place-items: center"</code>
        </p>
        <div
            style="display: grid; place-items: center"
            class="square250 bordered"
        >
            <p class="bordered" style="font-weight: bold; font-size: x-large">
                :-)
            </p>
