            Below list items have inherited margin-top property from parent
            element. Some CSS properties are inherited by default, some have to
            be implicitly specified to be inherited.
        </p>
        <ul class="margin-top">
            <li>First item</li>
            <li>Second item</li>
            <li style="margin-top: initial">
                Third item - it has also inline CSS setting margin-top to
                <code>initial</code>, which resets the inheritance.
            </li>
            <li>Fourth item</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            <code>unset</code> resets value back to what is the default
            behaviour for the element - <code>initial</code> that have this set
            by default and <code>inherit</code> respectively. It helps when we
            want set back to initial behaviour, but not remember which props are
            inherited by default and which are not.
