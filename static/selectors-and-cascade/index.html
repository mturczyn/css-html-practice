        <h2>Descendant recursion</h2>
        <p>
            When using space between selectors-and-cascade, that means we will
            select descendants of the first selector matching the latter. But
            descendants will be searched recursively, so no matter how deep
            descendant will be. For example, see below:
        </p>
        <p>
            Below we have nested divs, only top one has class set, that indent
            child divs, while each next div is child of other one. Result is
            that child selector applies to all children elements recursively, no
            matter how deep. So all divs are indented and those that are
            children of other divs, indents add up.
        </p>
        <div class="top">
            <div>
                <p>1 level deep</p>
                <div>
                    <p>2 levels deep</p>
                    <div>
                        <p>3 levels deep</p>
                    </div>

        <h1>Combinators</h1>
        <h2>Next sibling combinator</h2>
        <div class="bordered">
            <label>Example</label>
            <p>Below we have example of next sibling comibnator:</p>
            <p>
                Margin is applied only to next sibling, so exlucing first one.
                Other styles are applied to all children of the container.
            </p>
            <div class="bordered next-sibling-example">
                <p>First paragraph</p>
                <p>Second paragraph</p>

        </div>
        <h2>Subsequent-sibling</h2>
        <div class="bordered">
            <label>Example</label>
            <p>
                The subsequent-sibling combinator (~) separates two
                selectors-and-cascade and matches all instances of the second
                element that follow the first element (not necessarily
                immediately) and share the same parent element.
            </p>
            <code>p ~ span {color: red;}</code>
            <div class="bordered subsequent-sibling-examle">
                <span>This is first span.</span>
                <p>Here's first paragraph.</p>
                <span>This is second span after paragraph.</span>
            </div>
        </div>
        <h2>Direct children combinator</h2>
        <p>
            Used with > character, limits matching children only to direct
            descendants.
        </p>
        <h1>The cascade and specifity of the rules</h1>
        <p>
            CSS rules are calculated accordingly to specifity, if multiple rules
            apply to the same element.
        </p>
        <div class="bordered specifity-example">
            <p>This is first paragraph.</p>
            <p class="specifity-example-child">
                This is second paragraph - this paragraph has class set, which
                makes its CSS selector more specific.
            </p>
            <p>This is third paragraph.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="bordered another-specifity-example">
            <p class="spec-example">
                This is paragraph which is influenced by selector with most

            <span class="spec-example"
                >This span has the same class as above paragraph, but is colored
                differently, so above paragraph is styled by more specific
                selector.</span
            >
            <p>
                This paragraph has no class, and thus is influenced by other
                selector than one above.
